# 0x03. User Authentication Service

## Description
This project involves creating a user authentication service from scratch using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and bcrypt for learning purposes. The service will include functionalities such as user registration, login, session management, and more.

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project
- All Python files should end with a new line
- The first line of all Python files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and functions should have appropriate documentation
- Type annotations should be used for all functions
- Flask app should only interact with the `Auth` class and never directly with the database
